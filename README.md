# Nursing Fall Risk Assessment

## Project Overview

This project explores the assessment of **patient fall risk** in a clinical setting using nursing-related variables and basic data analysis techniques.

The goal is to simulate a **simple and interpretable decision-support approach**, inspired by commonly used fall risk assessment scales (e.g. the Morse Fall Scale).

The project is implemented in **Python** using **Google Colab** and is intended for educational and exploratory purposes.

## Objectives

- Identify key factors commonly associated with patient falls  
- Calculate a fall risk score based on clinical variables  
- Classify patients into **low, medium, or high fall risk categories**  
- Visualize and interpret results in a clear and structured way

## Nursing and Clinical Context

Patient falls are a major safety concern in healthcare settings.  
Risk assessment is a fundamental step in fall prevention strategies and typically involves evaluating multiple patient-related factors.

This project illustrates how **structured data and simple scoring logic** can support fall risk evaluation, while emphasizing that such tools are meant to **support—not replace—clinical judgment**.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is **fully simulated** and does not contain real patient data.

### Variables included:

- `age`: patient age  
- `previous_falls`: history of previous falls (yes/no)  
- `mobility`: level of mobility  
- `mental_status`: cognitive status  
- `risk_medications`: use of medications associated with increased fall risk

## Methodology

1. Data loading and basic exploration  
2. Assignment of weighted risk scores to each variable  
3. Calculation of a total fall risk score  
4. Risk classification:
   - Low risk  
   - Medium risk  
   - High risk  
5. Data visualization and interpretation

## Tools and Technologies

- Python in Google Colab

## How to Run the Project

1. Open the notebook in **Google Colab**  
2. Run all cells sequentially  
3. Review outputs, charts, and comments  

As this is a notebook-based project, **no additional installation is required**.

---

## Limitations

- The dataset is simulated and simplified  
- The scoring system is illustrative and not clinically validated  
- This project is **not intended for real-world clinical use**  

---

## Purpose

This project was created as a **learning and exploratory exercise**, combining:

- interest in healthcare-related problems  
- basic data analysis techniques  
- transparent and interpretable decision logic
