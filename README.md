# Nursing Fall Risk Assessment

## Project Overview

This project focuses on the assessment of **patient fall risk** in a clinical setting, using nursing-related variables and basic data analysis techniques.
The goal is to simulate a **decision-support tool for nurses**, inspidered by commonly used fall risk assessment scales (e.g. Morse Fall Scale).

The project is implemented in **Python** using **Google Colab** and is suitable for educational and accademic purposes.

## Objectives

- Identify key nursing factors associated with patient falls
- Calculate a fall risk score based on clinical variables
- Classify patients into **low, medium, or high fall risk**
- Visualize and interpret results from a **nursing perspective**

--- 

## Nursing Relevance

Patient falls are a major safety concern in healthcare settings.
Nurses play a crucial role in:

- assessing fall risk at admission and during hospitalization
- implementing preventive interventions
- monitoring high-risk patients

This project highlights how **data analysis can support nursing clinical judgment**, without replacing it.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is **simulated** and does not contain real patient data.

### Variables included:

- `age`: patient age
- `previous falls`: history of previous falls (yes/no)
- `mobility`: level of mobility
- `mental status`: cognitive status
- `risk medications`: use of medications associated with fall risk

---

## Methodology

1. Data loading and exploration
2. Assignment of risk scores to each variable
3. Calculation of a total fall risk score
4. Risk classification:
    - Low risk
    - Medium risk
    - High risk
5. Data visualization and interpretation

---

## Tools and Technologies

- Python in Google Colab

---

## How to run the project

1. Open the notebook in **Google Colab**
2. Run all cels sequentially
3. Review outputs, charts, and nursing interpretations

As it is a notebook project it doesn't require additional intstallations.

## Limitations

- The dataset is simulated and simplified
- The scoring system is for educational purposes only
- The model does not replace clinical assessment or validated tools

## Educational Purpose

This project was developed for **learning and academic use**, with a focus on:

- nursing assessment
- patient safety
- basic data analysis
